# Dart Asynchronous Operation Error Handling
This example showcases a potential issue in asynchronous Dart code when handling network requests and JSON data.  The code includes basic error handling using a try-catch block but could be more robust.  The solution demonstrates improved error handling to address potential `FormatException` during JSON decoding and null checks to prevent `NullPointerException`.

## Bug
The original code lacks comprehensive exception handling, potentially leading to application crashes if the API response is malformed or the network request fails unexpectedly.
